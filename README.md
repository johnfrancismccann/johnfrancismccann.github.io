[This](http://johnmccann.io) is my personal website. It is a modified version of [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/), which is a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) theme created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

# Overview

The most noticeable change to Freelancer would be the color scheme. I found the awesome smiley face on [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com/smiley-8/). For the contact form, I used [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) since the provided PHP from Freelancer can't run directly on GitHub Pages. Also, I had issues getting the [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) social media icons to display properly on some computers, so I used svg images instead. Seems to be working a bit more consistently. And elsewhere, I made a few small style changes.
